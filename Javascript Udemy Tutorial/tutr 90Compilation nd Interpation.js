// Compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once, 
// and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer.




// Interpretation: Interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line.


// Just-in-time (JIT) compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediately.
